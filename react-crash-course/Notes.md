# Notes
- One main root component
- All components should be Uppercase and function name is Uppercase
- Uppercase components are custom components while lowercase are build in component such as <div>,<p>,<section>
- Props are always a single object {} 
- In the return of the components (html) using {} is a special syntax to evaluate js expression 
- Inline style <div style={{ color: 'red', textAlign: 'center' }}>, the style takes in an object js expression 
- For scoped css used `.module.css` file to prevent class name conflicts, limited to only where its imported 
  - example `import styles from './Post.module.css'` object `styles` could be replace with any word, its just a variable name
- The component return html is a snapshot on initial load
- By using useState, when the state changes that component function gets executed again with the new html snapshot
- Props `children` is a special prop that allow additional component to be wrapped around custom component. 
  - example <Modal> <NewPost/> </Modal>
- Props convention naming if props is a receiving function should start with `on` 
  - example <MainHeader onCreate={fn}, onPost={fn} />
- Inside a form html, any button is recognized as type='submit' as default
