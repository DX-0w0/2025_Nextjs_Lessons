# Notes
- One main root component
- All components should be Uppercase and function name is Uppercase
- Uppercase components are custom components while lowercase are build in component such as <div>,<p>,<section>
- Props are always a single object {} 
- In the return of the components (html) using {} is a special syntax to evaluate js expression 
- Inline style <div style={{ color: 'red', textAlign: 'center' }}>, the style takes in an object js expression 
- For scoped css used `.module.css` file to prevent class name conflicts, limited to only where its imported 
  - example `import styles from './Post.module.css'` object `styles` could be replace with any word, its just a variable name
- The component return html is a snapshot on initial load
- By using useState, when the state changes that component function gets executed again with the new html snapshot
- Props `children` is a special prop that allow additional component to be wrapped around custom component. 
  - example <Modal> <NewPost/> </Modal>
- Props convention naming if props is a receiving function should start with `on` 
  - example <MainHeader onCreate={fn}, onPost={fn} />
- Inside a form html, any button is recognized as type='submit' as default 
- useEffect is used to handle side-effect, to run functions without having a direct effect on the html
- useEffect should not return an async promise. Instead create a new async function inside the useEffect and then immediate execute it afterwards
- useEffect has 2 parts, the function to be executed and an array of dependencies when it should be executed again 
- Can create `isLoading` state inside the useEffect, set to true at the beginning and false at the end of the function
- `Outlet` from the react-router-dom load the rest of the nested routes in the children array of objects 
- Routes are created by the `createBrowserRouter`
- use the `Link` when navigating between routes
- use the `useNavigate` hook to navigate inside a function
- In the route, there is a property call `loader` which loads all the necessary data before the element gets loaded. It can be async or sync 
- We can access the data with the `useLoaderData` hook any components on the element that used the `loader` function. The cb has a given data object that can be used. The data object has a property of `params`
- In the route, there is a property call `action` which is used with the `Form` component from the react-router-dom. The cb has a given data object that can be used. The data object has a property of `request`
- Using the `Form` give input `name` so it easier to get back the input data 
- Route `path` adding a `/` at the beginning is absolute path, without its relative path
- Dynamic path use the `:` keyword followed by a name `:id`
