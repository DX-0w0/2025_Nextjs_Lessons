```
- There are buildin components that are optimizated `https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/components`
  - Font, Form, Image, Link, Script
- Using buildin <Link> keep it as a single page app
- using <Image> lazy load image and add additional property to best serve the image, by adding `priority` to the image it no longer lazy load but load immediately, which help in preventing content shift and LCP
